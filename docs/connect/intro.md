## A Private contributor tool

- Connect functions as a private editor & contributor tool for contributors of open organisations. It allows teams to manage internal documents with full control over the data ownership. Connect is available as stand-alone desktop application or in the cloud.

- Connect offers a navigation menu for adding, synchronising and browsing document drives that are shared within an organisation or are private to the contributor. 

- Connect allows contributors to edit and work on different 'document model types' selected or defined by the organisation.
